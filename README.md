> Command palette for GitHub (browser extension)

I assume many of you use a command palette to run commands and navigate through your project in your favorite IDE. Did you know that GitHub has over 100 keyboard shortcuts? In all honesty, I know ten max and use not more than five regularly.

Wouldn't it be helpful to have a command palette that lets you easily find and run such keyboard shortcuts? And what about any repository, pull request, and issue you have visited recently?

I just started working on it, but if you're interested, please fill out this form to [join the private alpha](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCKkoVHLbIfMGNHPRJj66ODDjINPm3VKwl3KY5alvgr-1mqQ/viewform)
